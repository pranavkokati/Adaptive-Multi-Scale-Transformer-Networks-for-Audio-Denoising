# Adaptive Multi-Scale Transformer Networks for Audio Denoising: Plan

## Notes
- The project introduces four major innovations: multi-scale noise characterization, progressive cross-modal attention, self-supervised contrastive learning, and adaptive computational allocation.
- Implementation includes dynamic architecture scaling, contrastive learning, and multi-resolution dilated convolution analysis.
- Datasets: WHAMVox and VoiceBank+DEMAND are used for evaluation.
- Codebase is modular, with automated dataset integration and experiment tracking.
- Code must be professional: no comments after functions/classes, no synthetic data usage per user instructions
- Full professional codebase, documentation, automation, and dataset tools implemented
- All synthetic data and code removed; only real datasets (VoiceBank+DEMAND, WHAM, Microsoft SNSD if accessible, LibriSpeech) are allowed
- Implementation rigor matches scientific paper standards as requested
- Real dataset-only modules, scripts, and utilities created; project files organized into logical directories
- LibriSpeech (alternative real dataset) now used for training; all required directories created
- Real-data-only training pipeline running; end-to-end project run (training, evaluation, inference) completed and verified operational
- Some minor issues detected in demonstration scripts: missing model attributes (e.g., 'noise_characterizer'), type mismatch for torchaudio (PosixPath vs str), and incorrect metric usage ('Tensor' object has no attribute 'eval'). These need debugging for a flawless demo.
- Next: Generate research-quality graphs for paper and search for latest scientific enhancements in audio denoising.
- User requested full codebase refactor, cleanup, and professional file organization/naming for publication-ready format.
